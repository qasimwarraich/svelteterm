[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/qasimwarraich/svelteterm/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/qasimwarraich/svelteterm/-/commits/main)

## What is this?

This is a simple svelte app that uses xterm.js + golang + websockets to spawn
instances of docker containers where users can access the
[cli-tutor](https://gitlab.com/qasimwarraich/cli-tutor) program through the
comfort and "safety" of their browsers. 

### Try it out!
